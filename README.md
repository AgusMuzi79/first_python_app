Python project to visualize volcanoes and population on a map.

# üåã Volcanoes and Population Map

This project was developed as part of the [The Python Mega Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/former-python-mega-course-build-10-real-world-applications/) on Udemy. The application generates an interactive map that displays:

- The location of volcanoes in the U.S., with markers colored according to their elevation.
- An additional layer showing global population density, colored based on population size.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Practice reading and manipulating files (`.txt`, `.json`).
- Use `folium` to create interactive maps with multiple layers.
- Integrate `GeoJSON` to represent geographic data.
- Learn to use `LayerControl`, `FeatureGroup`, and `Popup` elements on a map.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)
- GeoJSON
- Basic HTML for popup customization
